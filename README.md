Cursor AI helped me with creating the index.html. For example:
link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"
ChatGPT helped me with setting up horizontal layout.

Style.css has 2 containers, 1 for input, 1 for output. 

To currently run, start the lm sudio server with Llama 3.2 on port 1234 with CORS enabled along with Serve on local network. Then open the index.html file.
